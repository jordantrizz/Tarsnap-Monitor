INTRODUCTION
------------
The TarsnapMonitor is intended to be an easy way to
programatically use a Tarsnap account's statistics
(bandwidth usage, storage, balance, etc) to whatever
means.  It was originally written to be able to make
projections as to when an account balance may run out.
TarsnapMonitor.class.php is the class that makes this
functionality available.  TarsnapMonitor.exec.php is
a sample client usage of the TarsnapMonitor class.
